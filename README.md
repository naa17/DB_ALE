Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 
Prerequisites
•	Java Development Kit 8 (with JavaFX)
•	IntelliJ IDE
Running the tests 
When the project is built using gradle, the unit tests are automatically run. If the tests pass, then the build has been successful.
Basic unit testing was done to test the different isolated parts of the system. For instance, the testIsValidEmailAddressFalse tests to see if the function isValidEmailAddress returns false for an invalid email address. If it does, the test has passed.
